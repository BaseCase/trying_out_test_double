Trying out [testdouble.js](https://github.com/testdouble/testdouble.js).


## Sample app
The sample app is a wishlist program, basically Amazon wishlists crossed with a
wedding registry.


## Features
* A user can have their own wishlist, to which they can add and remove items.

* An item in another user's wishlist can be "dibsed" to denote that the dibsing
user intends to buy it. The wishlist owner can't tell who dibsed their items.

* A user can request to see who dibsed an item, and that user can respond yes
or no to the request to reveal who they are.

* Items can be marked as "received" and the gifting user gets kudos for that.
